    <p>We need your permission to display notifications. If you have denied permission for notifications to this page in your browser, you will be unable to turn on (and receive) notifications from us. For Chrome, to see your notification permission head over to <a href="chrome://settings/content/notifications" target="_blank">Settings</a>. The GIF below will show you how to clear and grant permission again.</p>

    <p>To test notifications you can head over to <a href="notifications">Notifications</a> and click on <b>Test merchant spawn notification</b> / <b>Test item found notification</b>.

<FaqSection Header="I am missing some notifications?!">
    <p>Make sure you don't accidentally filter out the notification you want to see (<a href="notifications">Notifications</a>). If the issue still persists, the test notifications work but you are still missing them sometimes, make sure to check <u>Windows</u> notification assistant settings and <b>turn off</b> active filters ("When im playing a game", "When im in fullscreen"):</p>
